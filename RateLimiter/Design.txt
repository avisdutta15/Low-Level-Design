1. Requirements:
	1. The system should Rate Limit the users based on UserId and their tier(free or premium or more)
	2. Support 4 types of limiters (should be extensible)
	3. Thread Safe and Efficient
	4. Instead of Dropping the requests, can we have some buffering before the requests are addressed.
	5. Extend the system to not only limit users, but also services, IPs
	6. How to scale the service in Distributed World?


2. Design
	1. Main service called as RateLimiterService. This should be singleton.
	2. We setup the service using configurations passed from the application.
	3. Based on the RateLimiterOptions, we will choose the algorithm, bucket size, window size.
	   Each algorithm will take a different type of configuration.
	   We will setup the 
	4. It has an entry point HandleRequests()
	5. 
	6. The HandleRequest
	
	We will have 4 algorithms:
		1. Leaky Bucket
		2. Token Bucket
		3. Fixed Window
		4. Sliding Window




Awesome! Now lets create a RateLimiterService.
This service will have different RateLimiterAlgorithms - 
	TokenBucket (Keep Empty as of now), 
	LeakyBucket(already implemented), 
	Fixed Window (Keep Empty as of now),
	Sliding Window (Keep Empty as of now)

We will have rate limiters per user/service/ip. Keep a cache where we will store this.
On every request to the service, we get the correct limiter from this cache and apply the limiter.
