# Builder Desing Pattern

Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.

**Usage examples**: The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in C# world. It’s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.

**Identification**: The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object. Builder methods often support chaining (for example, someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()).


## Problem Statement ## 

![House](./Images/Builder1.png)

For example, let’s think about how to create a House object. To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls and a floor, install a door, fit a pair of windows, and build a roof. But what if you want a bigger, brighter house, with a backyard and other goodies (like a heating system, plumbing, and electrical wiring)?

The simplest solution is to extend the base House class and create a set of subclasses to cover all combinations of the parameters. But eventually you’ll end up with a considerable number of subclasses. Any new parameter, such as the porch style, will require growing this hierarchy even more.

There’s another approach that doesn’t involve breeding subclasses. You can create a giant constructor right in the base House class with all possible parameters that control the house object. While this approach indeed eliminates the need for subclasses, it creates another problem.

In most cases most of the parameters will be unused, making the constructor calls pretty ugly. For instance, only a fraction of houses have swimming pools, so the parameters related to swimming pools will be useless nine times out of ten.

## Solution ##
The Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called builders.

The pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps (buildWalls, buildDoor, etc.). To create an object, you execute a series of these steps on a builder object. The important part is that you don’t need to call all of the steps. You can call only those steps that are necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object.

Some of the construction steps might require different implementation when you need to build various representations of the product. For example, walls of a cabin may be built of wood, but the castle walls must be built with stone.

In this case, you can create several different builder classes that implement the same set of building steps, but in a different manner. Then you can use these builders in the construction process (i.e., an ordered set of calls to the building steps) to produce different kinds of objects.


## Production Code ##

```csharp
//ICustomLogger.cs
public interface ICustomLogger
{
    void LogInformation(string message);
    void LogWarning(string message);
    void LogError(string message);
}

//CustomLogger.cs
//Implement the Concrete Logger
public class CustomLogger : ICustomLogger
{
    private readonly string _logFilePath;
    private readonly bool _logToConsole;

    public CustomLogger(string logFilePath, bool logToConsole)
    {
        _logFilePath = logFilePath;
        _logToConsole = logToConsole;
    }

    public void LogInformation(string message)
    {
        WriteLog("INFO", message);
    }

    public void LogWarning(string message)
    {
        WriteLog("WARNING", message);
    }

    public void LogError(string message)
    {
        WriteLog("ERROR", message);
    }

    private void WriteLog(string level, string message)
    {
        string logMessage = $"{DateTime.Now} [{level}] {message}";

        if (_logToConsole)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(logMessage);
        }

        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(_logFilePath))
        {
            System.IO.File.AppendAllText(_logFilePath, logMessage + Environment.NewLine);
        }
    }
}


//LoggerBuilder.cs
//Create the Logger Builder
public class LoggerBuilder
{
    private string _logFilePath;
    private bool _logToConsole;

    public LoggerBuilder LogToFile(string filePath)
    {
        _logFilePath = filePath;
        return this;
    }

    public LoggerBuilder LogToConsole()
    {
        _logToConsole = true;
        return this;
    }

    public ICustomLogger Build()
    {
        return new CustomLogger(_logFilePath, _logToConsole);
    }
}


//Program.cs
//Client Code
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Use the builder to create a logger
        var logger = new LoggerBuilder()
            .LogToFile("logs.txt")
            .LogToConsole()
            .Build();

        // Log messages
        logger.LogInformation("Application started.");
        logger.LogWarning("Low disk space.");
        logger.LogError("Unhandled exception occurred.");
    }
}

```

### Explanation ###

**Builder Configuration**:
* The LoggerBuilder allows you to specify logging targets (file and/or console).

* Multiple methods (LogToFile, LogToConsole) can be chained to configure the logger.

**Flexible Construction**:

* The Build() method creates an instance of CustomLogger with the specified configuration.

**Separation of Concerns**:

* The builder handles the logger configuration.
* The CustomLogger class handles the actual logging implementation.
