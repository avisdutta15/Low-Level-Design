# Adapter Desing Pattern

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.


## Problem Statement

Imagine that you’re creating a stock market monitoring app. The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in `Json` format and then displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.

At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library. But there’s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in `XML` format.


#### Fix:
You could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library. And worse, you might not have access to the library’s source code in the first place, making this approach impossible.


## Solution

You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter. 

Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate. Here’s how it works:

The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects.
Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapter’s methods.

Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects.

Sometimes it’s even possible to create a two-way adapter that can convert the calls in both directions.

To solve the dilemma of incompatible formats, you can create XML-to-JSON adapters for every class of the analytics library that your code works with directly. Then you adjust your code to communicate with the library only via these adapters. When an adapter receives a call, it translates the incoming XML data into a JSON structure.

```csharp
//Define the Target Interface
public interface IDataProcessor
{
    string GetJsonData();
}

//Create the Adaptee
//The Adaptee is the existing data-service that emits data in XML format.
using System.Xml.Linq;

public class XmlDataService
{
    public string GetXmlData()
    {
        // Simulate fetching data in XML format
        var xml = new XElement("Data",
            new XElement("Id", 1),
            new XElement("Name", "John Doe"),
            new XElement("Age", 30)
        );
        return xml.ToString();
    }
}


//Implement the Adapter
//The adapter implements the IDataProcessor interface and internally uses the XmlDataService to fetch XML data, which it then converts into JSON format.
using System.Xml;
using System.Xml.Linq;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public class XmlToJsonAdapter : IDataProcessor
{
    private readonly XmlDataService _xmlDataService;

    public XmlToJsonAdapter(XmlDataService xmlDataService)
    {
        _xmlDataService = xmlDataService;
    }

    public string GetJsonData()
    {
        // Fetch XML data from the data-service
        string xmlData = _xmlDataService.GetXmlData();

        // Convert XML to JSON
        var xmlDoc = XDocument.Parse(xmlData);
        string jsonData = JsonConvert.SerializeXNode(xmlDoc);

        return jsonData;
    }
}


//Client Code
//The client-side service interacts only with the IDataProcessor interface and uses the adapter to fetch data in JSON format.
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Instantiate the Adaptee (data-service)
        var xmlDataService = new XmlDataService();

        // Use the Adapter to convert XML to JSON
        IDataProcessor dataProcessor = new XmlToJsonAdapter(xmlDataService);

        // Fetch and process JSON data
        string jsonData = dataProcessor.GetJsonData();

        // Client processes JSON data
        Console.WriteLine("Client received JSON data:");
        Console.WriteLine(jsonData);
    }
}

```

## Applicability
 * Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code.
 
 * The Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that serves as a translator between your code and a legacy class, a 3rd-party class or any other class with a weird interface.

 * Use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that can’t be added to the superclass.
